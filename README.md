I'll create a more specific README.md based on your code:

```markdown
# Text Summarizer

A text summarization application built using Hugging Face's transformers library and Gradio interface. This project uses the DistilBART CNN model to generate concise summaries of input text.

## Features
- Web-based interface using Gradio
- Powered by DistilBART CNN model
- Real-time text summarization
- User-friendly interface with input and output text boxes

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Gradio
- DistilBART CNN (sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SAM-012/TextSummerizer.git
cd TextSummerizer
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install torch transformers gradio
```

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

The application will launch a local web interface where you can:
1. Enter your text in the input textbox
2. Click submit to generate the summary
3. View the summarized text in the output textbox

## Code Structure
```python
# Main components:
- Input processing using Gradio interface
- Text summarization using DistilBART CNN model
- Torch bfloat16 precision for efficient processing
```

## Model Details
The project uses the `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6` model, which is:
- A distilled version of BART
- Fine-tuned on CNN articles
- Optimized for summarization tasks

Would you like me to add or modify any sections of this README? For example, I could:
1. Add more detailed usage examples
2. Include screenshots of the interface
3. Add more technical details about the model
4. Include troubleshooting steps
